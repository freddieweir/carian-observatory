# Internet Kill Switch Implementation

## Objective
Implement an emergency "hard switch" system that can immediately cut off all container internet access, requiring Authelia authentication to restore connectivity.

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Network Isolation
- Create isolated Docker network without external gateway
- Script to dynamically move containers between networks
- Preserve internal container-to-container communication

### Phase 2: Authentication Gate
- Integrate with Authelia for re-enablement
- Web interface for emergency activation/deactivation
- Multi-factor authentication requirement for restoration

### Phase 3: Service-Specific Control
- Granular control per service group (AI, monitoring, infrastructure)
- Whitelist critical services (authentication, monitoring)
- Configurable timeout for automatic restoration

## Implementation Components

```bash
# Emergency isolation script
./scripts/emergency/isolate-containers.sh

# Restoration via Authelia
./scripts/emergency/restore-connectivity.sh --auth-required

# Status monitoring
./scripts/emergency/connectivity-status.sh
```

## Security Benefits
- Immediate malware/breach containment
- Prevents data exfiltration
- Maintains internal platform functionality
- Requires authenticated approval for restoration
- Audit trail of isolation events

## Priority: Medium
**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours implementation + testing
