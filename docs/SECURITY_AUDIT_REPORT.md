# Security Audit Report - AI Infrastructure Project

**Date**: September 5, 2025  
**Scope**: Complete security audit following canary deployment issues  
**Status**: âœ… **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

## Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted after SearXNG canary deployment failures revealed significant security vulnerabilities. **All critical issues have been successfully remediated** and the repository is now secure for git operations.

---

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Found & Resolved

### 1. **Hardcoded Production Secrets** - RESOLVED âœ…

**Issue**: Production authentication secrets were hardcoded in docker-compose files
- `docker-compose.auth.yaml` contained production session secrets
- `configs/docker-compose.canary.yaml` contained hardcoded Authelia keys  
- `configs/docker-compose.canary-complete.yaml` contained WebUI and SearXNG secrets

**Resolution**:
- âœ… Replaced all hardcoded secrets with environment variables
- âœ… Used `${VARIABLE}` pattern for secure environment injection
- âœ… Added fallback defaults where appropriate for non-sensitive values

### 2. **SSL Private Keys Security** - RESOLVED âœ…

**Issue**: 20+ SSL private keys were at risk of git commit
- Keys present in `ssl_cert/` directory
- No protection against accidental commits

**Resolution**:
- âœ… Backed up all SSL private keys to secure location (`~/secure-backup/`)
- âœ… Removed private keys from filesystem  
- âœ… Verified comprehensive `.gitignore` coverage
- âœ… Created secure certificate deployment workflow

### 3. **SearXNG Canary Configuration** - RESOLVED âœ…

**Issue**: Canary SearXNG deployment failed due to incomplete configuration
- Missing `limiter.toml` in canary data directory
- Volume mount configuration incomplete

**Resolution**:
- âœ… Copied complete SearXNG configuration to canary directory
- âœ… Verified volume mount structure matches container expectations
- âœ… Canary SearXNG now properly configured for testing

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Improvements Implemented

### Certificate Management
- **Secure Deployment Script**: `scripts/deploy-certificates.sh`
  - Integrates with 1Password CLI for certificate retrieval
  - Automatic certificate/key validation and matching
  - Environment-specific deployment (prod/canary)
  - No sensitive data touches filesystem permanently

### Configuration Security
- **Environment Variable Pattern**: All secrets now use `${VARIABLE}` references
- **Separation of Concerns**: Production and canary use separate secret sets
- **Fallback Safety**: Non-sensitive defaults prevent startup failures

### Git Repository Security
- **Comprehensive .gitignore**: Already excellent coverage of sensitive patterns
- **Private Key Protection**: SSL keys completely excluded from git tracking
- **Database Exclusion**: User databases and session data properly ignored

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Canary Deployment Issues Analysis

### Root Cause: Volume Mount Misconfiguration
The canary SearXNG failures were caused by:
1. **Incomplete Configuration**: Missing `limiter.toml` in canary data directory
2. **Container Startup Failures**: SearXNG requires complete config structure
3. **Dependency Chain**: Perplexica depends on working SearXNG service

### Resolution Applied
- **Complete Config Structure**: Ensured all required files present in canary volumes
- **Volume Validation**: Verified mount points match container expectations  
- **Service Dependencies**: Fixed startup order and health checks

---

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Set Environment Variables**: Define all required secrets in production environment
   ```bash
   export AUTHELIA_SESSION_SECRET="your-production-secret"
   export AUTHELIA_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-storage-key"
   ```

2. **Deploy Certificates**: Use secure deployment script
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-certificates.sh prod
   ```

3. **Verify Configuration**: Check all services start cleanly
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.auth.yaml up -d
   ```

### For Canary Testing:
1. **Use Canary Secrets**: Set environment variables with `_CANARY` suffix
2. **Deploy Canary Certificates**: 
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-certificates.sh canary
   ```
3. **Start Canary Stack**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f configs/docker-compose.canary-complete.yaml up -d
   ```

## âœ… Repository Status

**SECURITY CLEARED FOR GIT OPERATIONS**

- âœ… No hardcoded secrets in any files
- âœ… No SSL private keys in repository
- âœ… No sensitive user data committed
- âœ… All configuration files use secure environment patterns
- âœ… Comprehensive `.gitignore` protection active
- âœ… Secure deployment workflows in place

The repository is now safe for:
- Git commits and pushes
- Public sharing (if desired)
- Collaborative development
- Automated CI/CD pipelines

## ðŸ”§ Maintenance Notes

### Regular Security Tasks:
1. **Certificate Rotation**: Use deployment script for updates
2. **Secret Rotation**: Update environment variables regularly  
3. **Audit Schedule**: Review configurations quarterly
4. **Backup Verification**: Ensure secure backups are maintained

### Monitoring:
- Watch for any hardcoded secrets in new commits
- Monitor certificate expiration dates
- Regular dependency security scans
- Container image vulnerability assessments
