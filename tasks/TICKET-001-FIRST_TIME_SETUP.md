# TICKET-001: First-Time Setup Automation

## Status: Open
## Priority: High
## Category: Infrastructure

## Objective

Implement comprehensive first-time setup automation for the Carian Observatory platform to ensure consistent deployment across environments.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites Validation
- Verify Docker and Docker Compose installation
- Check system requirements (CPU, RAM, disk space)
- Validate network port availability
- Confirm 1Password CLI/Connect Server availability

### Configuration Management
- Interactive domain configuration wizard
- SSL certificate generation or retrieval
- Environment variable template processing
- Service selection (production/canary/both)

### Security Setup
- Generate secure random secrets for Authelia
- Configure initial admin user with secure credentials
- Set up 2FA/WebAuthn requirements
- Validate SSL certificate chain

### Service Deployment
- Orchestrated container startup sequence
- Health check validation for each service
- Network connectivity verification
- Authentication flow testing

## Technical Specifications

### Implementation Approach
- Modular Python or Bash script architecture
- Idempotent operations (safe to re-run)
- Rollback capability on failure
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Configuration Sources
- Support for 1Password integration
- Local `.env` file fallback
- Interactive prompts for missing values
- Validation of all inputs

### Platform Compatibility
- macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, RHEL 8+)
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine support

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script completes full setup in under 5 minutes
- [ ] All services pass health checks after deployment
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] SSL certificates properly configured
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in logs
- [ ] Rollback leaves system in clean state

## Dependencies

- Docker Compose v2.0+
- OpenSSL for certificate generation
- 1Password CLI (optional but recommended)
- Python 3.8+ or Bash 4.0+

## Notes

Consider implementing progress indicators and clear status messages throughout the setup process for optimal user experience.
