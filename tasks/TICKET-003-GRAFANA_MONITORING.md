# TICKET-003: Grafana Monitoring Stack

## Status: Open
## Priority: High
## Category: Observability

## Objective

Deploy comprehensive monitoring and observability stack using Grafana, Prometheus, and associated exporters for the Carian Observatory platform.

## Requirements

### Metrics Collection

- Grafana for visualization
- Exporters for each service
- Alert Manager for routing

### Data Retention
- 30-day high-resolution metrics
- 1-year downsampled data
- Automatic data lifecycle management
- Backup strategy for configurations

### Security Integration
- Authelia SSO authentication
- Role-based access control
- Encrypted data transmission
- Audit logging for access

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All services reporting metrics
- [ ] Dashboards load in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Alerts fire within 1 minute of condition
- [ ] SSO authentication working
- [ ] Data retention policy active
- [ ] Resource usage under 5% overhead

## Dependencies

- Prometheus 2.40+
- Grafana 10.0+
- Service-specific exporters
- Persistent volume storage

## Notes

Focus on actionable metrics that directly impact user experience. Avoid metric sprawl by implementing clear naming conventions and documentation.
