# TICKET-002: Vulnerability Scanning Implementation

## Status: Open
## Priority: High
## Category: Security

## Objective

Integrate comprehensive vulnerability scanning into the Carian Observatory infrastructure to maintain security posture and compliance.

## Requirements

### Container Security
- Docker Scout integration for image scanning
- Trivy deployment for comprehensive analysis
- Automated scanning on image updates
- CVE database synchronization

### Application Security
- OWASP dependency checking
- Software composition analysis (SCA)
- License compliance verification
- Security misconfiguration detection

### Reporting
- Automated report generation (JSON, HTML, PDF)
- Severity-based alerting
- Trend analysis over time
- Integration with monitoring stack

## Technical Specifications

### Scanning Pipeline
- Pre-deployment scanning gates
- Scheduled periodic scans
- On-demand scan capability
- CI/CD pipeline integration

### Tool Integration
- Docker Scout CLI configuration
- Trivy server deployment
- Report aggregation service
- Alert routing configuration

### Data Management
- Vulnerability database updates
- Historical scan data retention
- Report archival strategy
- Metrics collection for analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All container images scanned before deployment
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities block deployment
- [ ] Reports generated within 2 minutes
- [ ] Zero false positives in production
- [ ] Integration with existing auth system
- [ ] Automated remediation recommendations

## Dependencies

- Docker Scout subscription (optional)
- Trivy open-source scanner
- Report generation templates
- Storage for scan results

## Notes

Prioritize integration with existing monitoring infrastructure. Consider implementing a grace period for non-critical vulnerabilities to avoid blocking deployments unnecessarily.
