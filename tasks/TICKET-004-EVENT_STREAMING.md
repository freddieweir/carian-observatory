# TICKET-004: Event Streaming Evaluation

## Status: Evaluation
## Priority: Medium
## Category: Infrastructure

## Objective

Evaluate and potentially implement event streaming architecture for real-time data processing and audit logging in the Carian Observatory platform.

## Requirements

### Evaluation Criteria
- Resource requirements analysis
- Performance impact assessment
- Complexity vs. benefit analysis
- Alternative solution comparison

### Use Cases
- AI interaction event tracking
- Audit log aggregation
- Asynchronous task processing
- Real-time analytics pipeline
- Service decoupling

### Technology Options
- Apache Kafka (full-featured, resource-intensive)
- RabbitMQ (lighter weight, mature)
- NATS (cloud-native, minimal footprint)
- Redis Streams (if Redis already deployed)

## Technical Specifications

### Proof of Concept
- Single-node deployment initially
- Message throughput testing
- Latency measurements
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Integration Points
- Open-WebUI event publishing
- Authelia audit events
- Nginx access logs
- Container lifecycle events

### Data Flow
- Event schema definition
- Topic/queue structure
- Consumer group design
- Dead letter queue handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] POC demonstrates <100ms latency
- [ ] Resource usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] Clear benefit over current architecture
- [ ] Integration complexity justified
- [ ] Operational overhead manageable
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan defined

## Dependencies

- Performance testing framework
- Resource monitoring tools
- POC environment allocation
- Time for thorough evaluation

## Notes

Start with lightweight evaluation before committing to full implementation. Consider starting with Redis Streams if Redis is already part of the stack, as it provides basic event streaming without additional infrastructure.
